# Hammerspoon Configuration: Markdown-style Shortcut Triggers for Notes.app

## Description:
- This script maps trigger strings like "## ", "# ", "> " in Notes.app to custom keybindings.
- It also provides global cursor movement hotkeys (Emacs-style).
- Terminal is excluded from hotkey effects to avoid conflict.# hammerspoon-configuration-macos-markdown
